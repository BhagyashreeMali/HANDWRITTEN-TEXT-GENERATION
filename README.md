# Handwritten Text Generation using Character-Level RNN

This project implements a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
to generate handwritten-like text based on learned writing patterns.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
2. Train the model
'''
python train.py
'''
3. Generate text
'''
python generate.py
'''
## Output
The model generates text that mimics human handwritten writing style
based on character-level patterns.

## Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- RNN

'''
Handwriting is a beautiful form of expression.
Every stroke carries emotion and intent.
The flow of letters creates a unique personal style.
